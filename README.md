## KiCAD Library Setup
Run the following command to install the third party KiCAD libraries used in the project

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

This project uses components from [digikey-kicad-library](https://github.com/Digi-Key/digikey-kicad-library) which is configured as a git submodule of this project. Git doesn't clone submodules of a project by default when the project it is cloned so this has to be done manually.
